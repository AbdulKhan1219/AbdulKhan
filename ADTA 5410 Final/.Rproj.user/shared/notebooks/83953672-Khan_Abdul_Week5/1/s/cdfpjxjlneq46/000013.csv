"0","#The Mean Squared Prediction Errors (MSPE) were assessed for both the linear regression model (referred to as linearmodel) and the generalized additive model (referred to as gam_model), utilizing the test_data dataset."

"0","#Analysis:"
"0",""
"0","#The linear regression model exhibits a lower MSPE in comparison to the generalized additive model. To be precise, the MSPE for the linear model is 1.133044, whereas for the GAM it is 1.159198."
"0",""
"0","#Conclusion:"
"0",""
"0","#Given its lower MSPE, the linear regression model (linearmodel) shows better prediction accuracy for the 'weight' variable within the test_data dataset. Hence, based on the MSPE metric, the linear model is the more suitable choice in this particular scenario."
"0",""
"0","#However, it is important to remember that evaluating models typically involves multiple criteria, and the selection of the most appropriate model may vary based on the specific objectives and the nature of the data involved."
